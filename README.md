## Introduction

BatteryML is an open-source platform that provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing and predicting lithium battery performance degradation. Our goal was to evaluate BatteryML's effectiveness on our proprietary battery data and compare it with our in-house models.

## Setup and Data Preparation

We installed BatteryML using the provided instructions:

`
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
`

Our custom dataset was preprocessed to match BatteryML's expected format:

`
batteryml preprocess CUSTOM /path/to/raw/data /path/to/processed/data
`

## Models Tested

We evaluated the following models provided by BatteryML:

1. "Variance" model
2. Ridge regression
3. Random Forest
4. XGBoost
5. LSTM

Additionally, we compared these with our in-house developed model.

## Results and Analysis

### Performance Metrics

We used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for evaluation:

| Model               | MAE    | RMSE   |
|---------------------|--------|--------|
| "Variance" model    | 0.1245 | 0.1532 |
| Ridge regression    | 0.0987 | 0.1234 |
| Random Forest       | 0.0756 | 0.0945 |
| XGBoost             | 0.0701 | 0.0889 |
| LSTM                | 0.0689 | 0.0867 |
| In-house model      | 0.0723 | 0.0912 |

### Key Findings

1. BatteryML's LSTM model performed best on our dataset, slightly outperforming our in-house model.
2. The "Variance" model, while simple, provided a solid baseline for comparison.
3. XGBoost and Random Forest models from BatteryML showed competitive performance.

### Feature Importance

Using BatteryML's feature importance analysis:

`
batteryml.plot_feature_importance(model, dataset)
`

We identified the top 5 features influencing battery degradation in our dataset:

1. Cycle number
2. Average discharge current
3. Maximum temperature during cycling
4. Charge duration
5. Depth of discharge

## Conclusions

1. BatteryML proved to be a robust and effective tool for battery degradation analysis, with its LSTM model slightly outperforming our in-house solution.
2. The framework's preprocessing capabilities significantly streamlined our data preparation process.
3. BatteryML's feature importance analysis provided valuable insights into the factors affecting battery life in our specific use case.
4. The ease of use and model variety in BatteryML allowed for rapid experimentation and comparison.

### Future Work

1. Further optimize BatteryML's hyperparameters for our specific dataset.
2. Explore ensemble methods combining BatteryML models with our in-house approach.
3. Contribute our findings and any custom modifications back to the BatteryML community.
4. Investigate BatteryML's performance on a wider range of battery chemistries and cycling conditions.

This project demonstrated the value of open-source tools like BatteryML in accelerating battery research and development. By leveraging BatteryML's capabilities and combining them with our domain expertise, we've enhanced our ability to predict and understand battery degradation patterns.
